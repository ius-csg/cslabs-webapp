## Theme / Libraries

This project uses [react-bootrstrap](https://react-bootstrap.github.io/components/alerts). Please use the documentation
to help build the UI. If there is a feature that `react-bootstrap` doesn't have then you can find a library to handle it 
for you by either googling or using github awesome lists like [this one](https://github.com/brillout/awesome-react-components)
or [this one](https://github.com/enaqx/awesome-react). (If you google awesome + {technology name} then you usually get a nice
list of helpful libraries.)


The bootstrap theme is located in `public/bootstrap/css/bootstrap.min.css` and the colors in `theme.scss` match the 
bootstrap theme otherwise bootstrap components will use one color scheme and the application will use another.
