      <h6>Binding Arbitration</h6>
      <div>
        If the Parties are unable to resolve a Dispute through informal negotiations,
        the Dispute (except those Disputes expressly excluded below) will be finally and
        exclusively resolved by binding arbitration.
        <br/>
        <b>
          YOU UNDERSTAND THAT WITHOUT THIS PROVISION, YOU WOULD HAVE THE RIGHT TO SUE IN COURT AND HAVE A JURY TRIAL.
        </b>
        The arbitration shall be commenced and conducted under the Commercial Arbitration Rules
        of the American Arbitration Association ("AAA") and, where appropriate,
        the AAA’s Supplementary Procedures for Consumer Related Disputes ("AAA Consumer Rules"),
        both of which are available at the AAA website www.adr.org.
        Your arbitration fees and your share of arbitrator compensation shall be governed
        by the AAA Consumer Rules and, where appropriate, limited by the AAA Consumer Rules.
        The arbitration may be conducted in person, through the submission of documents, by phone, or online.
        The arbitrator will make a decision in writing, but need not provide a statement of reasons
        unless requested by either Party. The arbitrator must follow applicable law,
        and any award may be challenged if the arbitrator fails to do so.
        Except where otherwise required by the applicable AAA rules or applicable law,
        the arbitration will take place in Floyd County, Indiana. Except as otherwise provided herein,
        the Parties may litigate in court to compel arbitration, stay proceedings pending arbitration,
        or to confirm, modify, vacate, or enter judgment on the award entered by the arbitrator.
        <br/>
        If for any reason, a Dispute proceeds in court rather than arbitration,
        the Dispute shall be commenced or prosecuted in the state and federal courts located in Floyd County,
        Indiana, and the Parties hereby consent to, and waive all defenses of lack of personal jurisdiction,
        and forum non conveniens with respect to venue and jurisdiction in such state and federal courts.
        Application of the United Nations Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods
        and the the Uniform Computer Information Transaction Act (UCITA) are excluded from these Terms of Use.
        <br/>
        In no event shall any Dispute brought by either Party related in any way to the Site
        be commenced more than one (1) years after the cause of action arose.
        If this provision is found to be illegal or unenforceable, then neither Party will elect to arbitrate
        any Dispute falling within that portion of this provision found to be illegal or unenforceable and
        such Dispute shall be decided by a court of competent jurisdiction within the courts listed for
        jurisdiction above, and the Parties agree to submit to the personal jurisdiction of that court.
      </div>
      <br/>
      <h6>Restrictions</h6>
      <div>
        The Parties agree that any arbitration shall be limited to the Dispute between the Parties individually.
        To the full extent permitted by law, (a) no arbitration shall be joined with any other proceeding;
        (b) there is no right or authority for any Dispute to be arbitrated on a class-action basis or to utilize
        class action procedures; and (c) there is no right or authority for any Dispute to be brought in a purported
        representative capacity on behalf of the general public or any other persons.
      </div>
      <br/><br/>
      <h6>Exceptions to Arbitration</h6>
      <div>
        The Parties agree that the following Disputes are not subject to the above provisions concerning
        binding arbitration: (a) any Disputes seeking to enforce or protect, or concerning the validity of,
        any of the intellectual property rights of a Party; (b) any Dispute related to, or arising from,
        allegations of theft, piracy, invasion of privacy, or unauthorized use; and (c) any claim for injunctive relief.
        If this provision is found to be illegal or unenforceable, then neither Party will elect to arbitrate
        any Dispute falling within that portion of this provision found to be illegal or unenforceable and
        such Dispute shall be decided by a court of competent jurisdiction within the courts listed for
        jurisdiction above, and the Parties agree to submit to the personal jurisdiction of that court.
